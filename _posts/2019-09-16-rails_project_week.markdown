Well it has been a long road up to this point, my jobs has kept me busy for 50-60 hours a week. Somehow I have still found time to complete this coding bootcamp! While I generally fall a week or two behind between the projects, having two weeks plus a break for project week allows me to catch up on that work. It is hard to believe a week ago from today I was finishing my last lab and starting on this project. Key takeaways from this project were developing the relationships between each of the models. 

After working with a couple other students, to ensure I met the relationship requirements I discovered that was not the case last night. I used Lucid Chart.com to help map out my various models and made some adjustments, unfortunately these adjustments set me back a bit. In order to make this deadline I had to compromise in a couple areas, one of those was the front in formatting. Plenty of refactoring to come! 

RentalPro-2.0 is a software suite that helps rental outfits track equipment, who it is rented to and the current status. The reason I chose equipment is they have great relational characteristics in which I could easily relate to. 

When a user signs up, they create their customers, add equipment and finally create rentals. Rentals belong to a customer and a piece of equipment. When a piece of equipment is checked out it is stamped with a checkout time and made unavailable until it is checked back in. The user can view rental history of companies and of equipment. Further buildout of the application would consist of calculating cost based on the rental time. Enjoy!
