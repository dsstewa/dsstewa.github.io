Over the last year of learning to code, it is amazing the knowledge I have gained. With every line of code written I learn something new. The new challenges, the ability to search and scrape the wealth of resources on the internet keeps me engaged everyday. The challenge of figuring it out, getting your product to work is awesome. After your code is working, the art of refactoring your code is something to be proud of. It is an amazing world, learning additional languages, packages and gems!
