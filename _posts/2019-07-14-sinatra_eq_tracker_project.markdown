Sinatra EQ Tracker Project


Well looks like the second project is a wrap! This project was a bit more complicated then the last as we were dealing with databases, user authentication, managing data and object relationships. Project required the use of two models for my case we used a basic User has many project, project belongs to a user. 

Users are required to login and authenticate prior to using the platform. From there they could view all the projects and create new projects. Users could only edit and delete the projects they created, not other users projects. While this is all real basic it was the first application built from the ground up based off of what we have learned. Ideally I would have preferred to add some additional functionality, however working 50-60 hours a week in additional to this course works makes it tough to stay on track. Looking forward to getting into Rails!
