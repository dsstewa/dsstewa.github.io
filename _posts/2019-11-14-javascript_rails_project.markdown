It is truly amazing how quickly this course is going by, I can remember starting the "pre work" around this time last year... In fact, my first ever commit to github was on November 29th, 2018 I will definitely be celebrating that at the end of the month. 

So, while this project is basic it is all encompassing. This was the first time we were able to pull it all together. We have the front end working with the back end, it's a beautiful thing! The ability to use fetch and have an interactive website is amazing. The tools that we can now build are pretty incredible, I canâ€™t wait to jump head first into React!
