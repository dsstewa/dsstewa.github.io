The challenge with development and what I think keeps people (engineers) engaged is the constant challenge of building a product. A product can be built in many different languages each with their own respective pros and cons. Every engineer has their own unique opinion, one engineer will say Ruby is the best another the opposite. Part of navigating the field is ensuring you are picking the right platform for the right application. The DevOps Cycle is incredibly interesting as you are laying the groundwork for a successful application. Planning your platform around how your application will be run, will it be run on serverless architecture? Kubernetes? All questions that are fun to figure out!
