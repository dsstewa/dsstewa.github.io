Well just like that we have started our first Flatirons project! It is hard to believe that I started the pre-work back in December and here we are all the way in May, two months into the course (March 11th start date).

My first project and first ever push to Git hub is a CLI app called CAIC_Forecast. CAIC stands for the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. CAIC is relied upon by many back country enthusiasts who recreate in the back country during the winter months. During the spring months CIAC combines many of the regions into three, Northern Mountains, Central Mountains and Southern Mountains. Each zone or region is then given a daily danger rating of Low (1), Moderate (2), Considerable (3), High (4), and Extreme (5). The CAIC forecast app scrapes the CAIC website, the prints out each of the regions or locations. Users are then given the option to pick a region, at that time the current forecast and the forecast for the next day are displayed on the screen.  The user is then given the option to display the forecast summary or return to the menu. I hope you enjoy!
